## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a very simple exercise, I used it to see how long it would take me to create this. I thought it was going to take me 2 hours and it took me 1.5 hours. So that was pretty interesting.

### Continued development

I tried a different approach form the things that I was usually doing. I decided not to create a class name and the turn it on or of, but to make all the style changes directly form Javascript. It was interesting, to this point I really don't know what is the best practice to do this kinds of things but is good to see that I have many options.

### Useful resources

For this exercise I didn't have to use any reference.
